yo what up zach.

some instructions:

1)you'll need python installed on your computer obviously to run this script.

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
^^^ this is the link to install for windows. use the 64 bit web based install

2) once you have python downloaded youll need to install some libraries
-open command prompt
-type "pip3 install openpyxl" then press enter
-next type "pip3 install python-docx" then press enter
^^^if these don't work change "pip3" with just "pip" and it should work

3) Ok, now lets run the script and make some copies!
-You must put the excel file and the word doc in the same folder as the script
-to run my script type "python3 script.py"
-it will prompt you for the excel file name (include the extension .xlsx)
-then it will prompt you for the word document (include .docx)
-then it will ask for the folder name where you want to put the docs
-then it will ask for each documents name
-after you have filled out all the questions it should be done!

4) congrats! and lmk if it works... we might have to do some configuration
together if it didnt work properly...
